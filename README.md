Fun with turtle functions
By Jordan Wolff

The goal is to write a program that allows the user to provide the number of sides per rotation of a spiral and automatically calculate the amount to lengthen the line to keep the gap between the lines similar, regardless of the number of turns.  I may also play around with the colors and perhaps writing out a final message.
